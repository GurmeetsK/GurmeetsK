### DataPoints create a story like pixels create a picture. :thought_balloon:

I am Gurmeet Kapoor, a writer :books: who's bitten the data analysis bug. :computer: :chart_with_upwards_trend:

You're going to find tons of interesting projects to see on my portfolio and if you are new to the wonderful world of data,
you're going to learn with me too!

## Currently, the projects you can see on my Github are (***All Using SQL***):

* [An Analysis on Faculty Salaries at the University of Vermont.](https://github.com/GurmeetsK/University-of-Vermont-Salary-Analysis)
* [An Analysis on Bus Delay in the city of Toronto during the first six months of 2022.](https://github.com/GurmeetsK/TTC-Bus-Delay-Analysis)
* [An Analysis on the emissions of vehicles sold in Canada in 2022](https://github.com/GurmeetsK/CO2-Emissions-2022-Cars-in-Canada)

## What's next?

*  The exploration of the fascinating language that is Python. The artist for my first project? The Beatles.

*  I'll be starting a blog that combines the world of Data Analysis and Art.

## What more?

 I've 
* Edited a published screenplay
* Written a few blog posts
* And made some movies. 

This list, like the one above, will also be constantly updated ‚è©
