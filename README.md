I am Gurmeet Kapoor! I am a writer :books: who's bitten the data analysis bug. :computer: :chart_with_upwards_trend:

You're going to find tons of interesting projects to see on my portfolio and if you are new to the wonderful world of data,
you're going to learn with me too!

## Currently, the projects you can see on my Github are (***All Using SQL***):

3. [An Analysis on the emissions of vehicles sold in Canada in 2022](https://github.com/GurmeetsK/CO2-Emissions-2022-Cars-in-Canada)

## What's next?

**1.A beginning of the exploration of the art that is Python. **
The artist for my first project? #The Beatles.**
